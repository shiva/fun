Compiling the examples 
======================
This project uses cmake to generate makefiles, that can then be used to build target for your platform. Out-of-source builds are supported and the instructions below will build everything within the build directory.

On linux machines, you will need the following

    cmake - version 2.6 or greater (you can install this using apt-get)
    make/gmake - the default should suffice
    gcc/something other c compiler - the default should suffice

Steps to compile all targets:

    # cd $CHECKOUT/build
    # cmake ../
    # make

The above commands generate binaries and libraries in $CHECKOUT/build/bin and 
$CHECKOUT/build/lib respectively.
